1) Run command:- python3 RSA_key_gen.py

-> It will ask the key size you wish to use for RSA. Once you run this code, all the public and private keys are generated.

2) Run command:- python3 encryption.py

-> It will ask to enter location of input text = "Inp.txt". This is the given text which we are interested in transfering. Then enter location of vigenere key = "vigKey.txt" which is also given to us. This code will store the encrypted text in cipher.txt file.
